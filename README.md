ðŸŽµ Spotify Clone is a responsive music streaming web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It mimics the core design and functionality of Spotify, allowing users to play/pause songs and navigate through a playlist UI. This project showcases my frontend development skills and understanding of dynamic UI interactions.
